This is my first game in Java.
Also this is my first try of using JFrame and other JComponents.
I tried to use the window like a map and I used an array to give a value to each tale. And when I want to move something I could just change the values in the map array and that would automatically change in the screen also there is a multiplayer version of this game if you want you could chack it out you can.
I hope you enjoy from the game.
